# Active Context

This document tracks the current focus of development, including recent changes, next steps, and active considerations.

## Current Focus

The current focus is on the initial project setup and camera integration. The primary goal is to establish a solid foundation for the application by creating the necessary project structure, defining the core modules, and ensuring that the camera can be successfully activated to capture and display a video stream. This foundational work is crucial before implementing more complex features like vision processing and language model integration.

## Recent Changes

*To be defined.*

## Next Steps

The immediate next steps are:

1.  **Verify Camera Functionality**: Run the `main.py` script to confirm that the camera initializes correctly and that the video feed is displayed without errors.
2.  **Implement Basic Vision Logic**: Begin implementing the `find_frame` method in the `vision.py` module to detect the cardboard frame in the video stream.
3.  **Integrate Vision and Main Loop**: Modify the `main.py` loop to pass the camera frames to the `Vision` module and display the results.
4.  **Develop a Test Suite**: Create an initial test case in `tests/test_camera.py` to verify the functionality of the `Camera` class.
