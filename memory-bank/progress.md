# Progress

This document tracks the project's status, including what works, what's left to build, and any known issues.

## What Works

- **Project Scaffolding**: A complete Python package structure has been created with `pyproject.toml`, a `src` directory containing the main package, and a `tests` directory.
- **Modular Structure**: The core modules (`camera`, `audio`, `language`, `vision`, `main`) have been created with initial class definitions and placeholder logic.
- **Camera Module**: The `camera.py` module is implemented with a `Camera` class capable of initializing a camera device and capturing frames using OpenCV.
- **Main Application Loop**: The `main.py` script contains a basic loop that initializes the camera and displays the video feed in a window, ready for testing.
- **Documentation**: A `README.md` file has been created with basic project information and setup instructions. The memory bank has been updated to reflect the current state of the project.

## What's Left to Build

- **Vision Processing**: The `vision.py` module needs to be implemented to detect the cardboard frame and extract the relevant image and action card.
- **Language Model Integration**: The `language.py` module needs to be integrated with the main application loop to process the visual input and generate responses.
- **Audio Output**: The `audio.py` module needs to be implemented with a text-to-speech engine to voice the model's responses.
- **Testing**: A comprehensive test suite needs to be developed to ensure the reliability of all modules.
